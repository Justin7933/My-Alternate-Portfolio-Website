My Portfolio Website
*I had messaged Mike about this assignment. I found a template that I really liked and used it for this assigment. I asked Mike if I could use it and he said that is fine with him.

Technolgies used during this was html,css,bootstrao, javascript,fontAwesome, and google drive.



 This is my portfolio website. It includes links to my linkedin, github profile, email and my resume. I also added 4 projects from my github profile to showcase what I have done so far.

 My email is justindamon84@gmail.com if you need to contact me.
